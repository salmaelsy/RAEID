# RAEID 
## Road and Environment Incidents Detection

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.3.

## -- Why RAEID?
This website is in the deployment phase of the AI model. This model detects incidents on the road 
(fire, car crash, car damage, car flipped, and floods). Then the result will pass into this website in order to notify the emergency service to take action.  

## Home Page 
- Page with some statistics about the incidents types and immediate notification once incidents have happened
- The home page also has a card that determines if the road status is  $DENSE$ or $SPARSE$ 

$${\color{red}DENSE}$$           |  $${\color{Green}SPARSE}$$
